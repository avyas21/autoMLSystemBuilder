================================================================================
🤖 AutoML Agent - Direct Mode
================================================================================
You are to generate TWO files:

1.  model.py - A Python file that includes:

-   A PyTorch model class (nn.Module) appropriate for the dataset.
-   A train() function that trains the model for multiple epochs.
-   A validate() function that evaluates the model on a validation dataset and reports metrics.
-   An if __name__ == '__main__' block with argparse CLI.
-   Only output the code

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1.  ARGPARSE INTERFACE - Use these EXACT argument names: --train (path to training data) --val (path to validation data) --epochs (number of epochs) --batch-size (batch size) --lr (learning rate). Default the epochs, batch size, and learning rate to reasonable values based on common practices.

2.  DEVICE HANDLING - MUST support both CPU and GPU: device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'). Ensure that the model and data are moved to the appropriate device in both train() and validate() functions.

3.  TRAINING LOOP - Proper structure:
    -   The train function should accept epochs as a parameter and run the full training loop.
    -   Print the average loss per epoch (not just the last batch).
    -   In the main block, call train() ONCE with all epochs, not in a loop.

4.  LOGGING - Print after each epoch: Epoch X/Y: Train Loss: 0.XXXX, Train Acc: XX.XX%, Val Loss: 0.XXXX, Val Acc: XX.XX%.

5.  CHECKPOINTING - Save the model when the validation metric improves: torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_model.pth'). Print a message when saving: 'Saved best model (Val Acc: XX.XX%)'.

6.  CODE QUALITY:
    -   Use clear and descriptive variable names.
    -   Add docstrings to all functions.
    -   Handle edge cases (e.g., empty datasets, etc.).

7.  DEPENDENCIES - ONLY use these libraries:
    -   torch (and torch.nn, torch.optim, torch.utils.data)
    -   pandas (for CSV reading)
    -   numpy (optional)
    -   torchvision (ONLY for ImageFolder OR transfer learning)

Dataset Description: STL-10 Dataset

Dataset schema facts: {
  "train_path": "datasets/stl10_train.csv",
  "val_path": "datasets/stl10_test.csv",
  "type": "csv",
  "n_columns": 27649,
  "task": "classification",
  "n_classes": 10,
  "sample_shape": "1000 rows \u00d7 27649 columns",
  "split_type": "csv"
}

Dataset type Specific handling: 
- Task: Classification with 10 classes
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
- Metrics: Accuracy

DATASET TYPE: CSV Image Data
 - CSV rows contain: label + flattened pixel values
 - Automatically infer image shape and channels from row length:
        num_pixels = len(row) - 1  # exclude label
        if (num_pixels ** 0.5).is_integer():
             height = width = int(num_pixels ** 0.5)
             channels = 1  # single-channel grayscale
        else:
             height = width = int((num_pixels // 3) ** 0.5)
             channels = 3  # multi-channel image
 - After reshaping into (H,W,C) or (C,H,W), the model.py MUST:
       - Convert NumPy → PIL using transforms.ToPILImage()
       - Apply PIL-based torchvision transforms (Resize, ColorJitter, etc.)
       - Convert back to tensor using transforms.ToTensor()        
 - transforms must run on PIL images, NOT on raw tensors
 - Correct preprocessing pipeline MUST be:
        img = img.reshape(H, W, C)
        img = transforms.ToPILImage()(img)
        img = transform_pipeline(img)  
 - Normalization MUST use ImageNet statistics when using pretrained models:
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std  = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
 - If the image is grayscale, convert to 3-channel AFTER converting to tensor:
        if tensor.shape[0] == 1:
            tensor = tensor.repeat(3,1,1)

MODEL ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS: 
- Transfer learning must be preferred when it improves accuracy. If transfer learning fits the dataset (e.g., 3-channel images), the generated model.py should:
    - Use a pretrained model such as ResNet18 or MobileNetV3
    - Freeze all pretrained layers:
        for param in model.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False

    - Replace the classifier head with a new Linear layer of correct output size
    - Use adaptive pooling or a dummy forward pass to compute flatten size dynamically

- If transfer learning is NOT appropriate:
  - (e.g., tiny grayscale dataset), generate a small CNN.
- Aim for >90% accuracy.
- The model MUST compute the flatten dimension dynamically during initialization using a dummy forward pass. Do NOT hardcode the input size to the fully-connected layer. Define all layers used in forward() before calling the flatten-size computation helper.
- In forward(), flatten using torch.flatten(x, 1) — NEVER use x.view(-1, fixed_number).

    You are the LEADER agent.

    You DO NOT write code.  
    You generate the FULL AND COMPLETE prompt for the MODEL AGENT to use on the next run FOR ANY CSV IMAGE DATASET.

    Here is the current model agent prompt:
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    You are to generate TWO files:

1.  model.py - A Python file that includes:

-   A PyTorch model class (nn.Module) appropriate for the dataset.
-   A train() function that trains the model for multiple epochs.
-   A validate() function that evaluates the model on a validation dataset and reports metrics.
-   An if __name__ == '__main__' block with argparse CLI.
-   Only output the code

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1.  ARGPARSE INTERFACE - Use these EXACT argument names: --train (path to training data) --val (path to validation data) --epochs (number of epochs) --batch-size (batch size) --lr (learning rate). Default the epochs, batch size, and learning rate to reasonable values based on common practices.

2.  DEVICE HANDLING - MUST support both CPU and GPU: device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'). Ensure that the model and data are moved to the appropriate device in both train() and validate() functions.

3.  TRAINING LOOP - Proper structure:
    -   The train function should accept epochs as a parameter and run the full training loop.
    -   Print the average loss per epoch (not just the last batch).
    -   In the main block, call train() ONCE with all epochs, not in a loop.

4.  LOGGING - Print after each epoch: Epoch X/Y: Train Loss: 0.XXXX, Train Acc: XX.XX%, Val Loss: 0.XXXX, Val Acc: XX.XX%.

5.  CHECKPOINTING - Save the model when the validation metric improves: torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_model.pth'). Print a message when saving: 'Saved best model (Val Acc: XX.XX%)'.

6.  CODE QUALITY:
    -   Use clear and descriptive variable names.

    -   pandas (for CSV reading)
    -   numpy (optional)
    -   torchvision (ONLY for ImageFolder OR transfer learning)

Dataset Description: {{dataset_description}}

Dataset schema facts: {{facts_json_here}}

Dataset type Specific handling: 
{{dataset_type_specific_handling}}

DATASET TYPE: CSV Image Data
 - CSV rows contain: label + flattened pixel values
 - Automatically infer image shape and channels from row length:
        num_pixels = len(row) - 1  # exclude label
        if (num_pixels ** 0.5).is_integer():
             height = width = int(num_pixels ** 0.5)
             channels = 1  # single-channel grayscale
        else:
             height = width = int((num_pixels // 3) ** 0.5)
             channels = 3  # multi-channel image
 - After reshaping into (H,W,C) or (C,H,W), the model.py MUST:
       - Convert NumPy → PIL using transforms.ToPILImage()
       - Apply PIL-based torchvision transforms (Resize, ColorJitter, etc.)
       - Convert back to tensor using transforms.ToTensor()        
 - transforms must run on PIL images, NOT on raw tensors
 - Correct preprocessing pipeline MUST be:
        img = img.reshape(H, W, C)
        img = transforms.ToPILImage()(img)
        img = transform_pipeline(img)  
 - Normalization MUST use ImageNet statistics when using pretrained models:
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std  = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
 - If the image is grayscale, convert to 3-channel AFTER converting to tensor:
        if tensor.shape[0] == 1:
            tensor = tensor.repeat(3,1,1)

MODEL ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS: 
- Transfer learning must be preferred when it improves accuracy. If transfer learning fits the dataset (e.g., 3-channel images), the generated model.py should:
    - Use a pretrained model such as ResNet18 or MobileNetV3
    - Freeze all pretrained layers:
        for param in model.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False

    - Replace the classifier head with a new Linear layer of correct output size
    - Use adaptive pooling or a dummy forward pass to compute flatten size dynamically

- If transfer learning is NOT appropriate:
  - (e.g., tiny grayscale dataset), generate a small CNN.
- Aim for >90% accuracy.
- The model MUST compute the flatten dimension dynamically during initialization using a dummy forward pass. Do NOT hardcode the input size to the fully-connected layer. Define all layers used in forward() before calling the flatten-size computation helper.
- In forward(), flatten using torch.flatten(x, 1) — NEVER use x.view(-1, fixed_number).

    ---------------------------------------------------------

    Your task:
    - Analyze the problems, failures, performance, architecture, training behavior.
    - Create a brand-new, fully rewritten Model Agent Prompt.
    - This new prompt must contain EVERYTHING the Model Agent needs to generate a future model.py.
    - Keep both performance and duration of model training in mind. 
    - DO NOT reference past prompts; produce a full standalone prompt.
    - DO NOT output code.
    - Output ONLY the prompt text, no extra delimiters.

    New MODEL AGENT prompt:
    
You are to generate TWO files:

1. model.py - A Python file that includes:

- A PyTorch model class (nn.Module) appropriate for the dataset.
- A train() function that trains the model for multiple epochs.
- A validate() function that evaluates the model on a validation dataset and reports metrics.
- An if __name__ == '__main__' block with argparse CLI.
- Only output the code

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. ARGPARSE INTERFACE - Use these EXACT argument names: --train (path to training data) --val (path to validation data) --epochs (number of epochs) --batch-size (batch size) --lr (learning rate). Default the epochs, batch size, and learning rate to reasonable values based on common practices.

2. DEVICE HANDLING - MUST support both CPU and GPU: device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'). Ensure that the model and data are moved to the appropriate device in both train() and validate() functions.

3. TRAINING LOOP - Proper structure:
   - The train function should accept epochs as a parameter and run the full training loop.
   - Print the average loss per epoch (not just the last batch).
   - In the main block, call train() ONCE with all epochs, not in a loop.

4. LOGGING - Print after each epoch: Epoch X/Y: Train Loss: 0.XXXX, Train Acc: XX.XX%, Val Loss: 0.XXXX, Val Acc: XX.XX%.

5. CHECKPOINTING - Save the model when the validation metric improves: torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_model.pth'). Print a message when saving: 'Saved best model (Val Acc: XX.XX%)'.

6. CODE QUALITY:
   - Use clear and descriptive variable names.
   - Add docstrings to all functions.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., empty datasets, etc.).

7. DEPENDENCIES - ONLY use these libraries:
   - torch (and torch.nn, torch.optim, torch.utils.data)
   - pandas (for CSV reading)
   - numpy (optional)
   - torchvision (ONLY for ImageFolder OR transfer learning)
